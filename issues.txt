My next thing to do is to automate everything so that my data can be uploaded to google drive so that the data is secure in the cloud.
There was mainly 2 ways to do this

1. import selenium
2. import pyautogui

Issues of selenium
------------------
a. Google is highly secure.
b. Because google is too secure, the chrome driver extension of selenium is not enough secure for logging in. So Google prompts to use
    another browser to login

So I stopped developing using selenium.(But no issue is there for logging into INSTAGRAM. ps I also tried making an instagram bot a while ago)

I am proceeding with pyautogui

There are some issues with pyautogui :-
  a. Of course, this is program is designed for my computer. The values in the braces are coordinates of the pixel that need to be clicked.
      So to get the pixel values, I needed to create a small sub-program just to get the coordinates of the pixel needed to click. This means I had to
      run the sub-program by placing the mouse at my needed position and run the sub-program without moving the mouse as the sub-program outputs
      the mouse location. So I had to find all the pixel values individually.
